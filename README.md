I made this project so that I could learn how to use barebones JS. Despite having used [NuxtJS](https://nuxt.com/) in the past, I actually have never used regular JavaScript and have no idea what a lot of the stuff I used actually did under the hood. Doing this project taught me a lot about how vanilla JS works and what the things in frameworks actually do.

This project uses the [date.nager.at](https://date.nager.at/PublicHoliday/United-States) API, parses it, lists the holiday name, and then does some simple math using the JavaScript `Date` object to count how many days there are until that holiday.

Making this project was suprisingly difficult. Interacting with new APIs and document queries in what functionally was a new language to me was a welcome challenge and one that I am glad I did.
